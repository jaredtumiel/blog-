Hey, I'm Jared! I ~~sometimes read Karl Friston papers~~ am an independent researcher, interested in the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference. I studied medicine in South Africa, and everything was going fine until [my *very smart* brother](https://ttumiel.github.io/blog/) started university and I heard him talking about all this awesome machine learning stuff. I did what **any** older sibling would do and tried to compete - teaching myself from his course notes and what I could find online. 4 years later, he's got an engineering degree, and I'm calling myself an "independent researcher" on the internet. Things are good.

## Where else to find me

I have a podcast [Apple](https://apple.podtangent.com), [Spotify](https://spotify.podtangent.com) where I speak with my good friend [Gianluca](https://twitter.com/QVagabond) about AI, medicine, and neuroscience.
